## Overview

This is the core .NET client lib of Speckle. It provides: 
- async methods for calling the speckle [api](https://speckleworks.github.io/SpeckleOpenApi/) 
- methods for interacting with the speckle's websocket api
- the core conversion methods (`Serialise` and `Deserialise`) & other helper methods
- a base SpeckleObject from which you can inherit to create your own speckle kits

Pretty much all of speckle's connectors are using this library, including:
- Rhino
- Grasshopper
- Revit
- Dynamo
- Unity (with flavours)

## Example usage

Please check [out the docs and sample starter project on the speckle website](https://speckle.systems/docs/developers/dotnet-sdk)!
